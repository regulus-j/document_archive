## Overview
A simplified, intuitive document management workflow similar to Google Drive but optimized for organizational document processing and approval workflows.

2. **Single Source of Truth**: One place for each action, eliminating confusion
3. **Smart Defaults**: Minimize user decisions while maintaining flexibility
4. **Clear Status Tracking**: Always know where a document stands

## **PHASE 1: DOCUMENT LIFECYCLE**

### 1. Document Creation & Upload
```
Creator ‚Üí Upload Document ‚Üí Set Basic Properties ‚Üí Choose Distribution Method
```

**Actions:**
- Upload file(s) with drag-and-drop interface
- Set title, description, classification (Public/Private/Confidential)
- Choose category (Memo, Report, Letter, etc.)
- **Decision Point**: 
  - "Share for Information Only" (no workflow)
  - "Send for Review/Approval" (triggers workflow)

**Default Behavior:**

- Default classification: Private
- Auto-detect file type and suggest category

### 2. Document Distribution Setup
```
Creator ‚Üí Select Recipients ‚Üí Choose Workflow Type ‚Üí Set Parameters ‚Üí Send
```

**Workflow Types (Simplified):**
- **Sequential**: Document goes to recipients one by one

**Parameters:**
- Due date (optional, defaults to 7 days)

  - **Completed** (processed)
  - **Sent** (documents I created/forwarded)

---

### 4. Document Processing (Simplified Actions)
```
Recipient ‚Üí Open Document ‚Üí Choose Action ‚Üí Add Comments (optional) ‚Üí Submit
```

**Available Actions (Context-Aware):**
